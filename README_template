Where to learn more about quick_orm?
************************************
As said above, quick_orm is built upon SQLAlchemy. Quick ORM never tries to hide SQLAlchemy's flexibility and power. Everything availiable in SQLAlchemy is still available in quick_orm. 

So please read the documents of SQLAlchemy, you would learn much more there than you could here.  

Read quick_orm's source code, try to improve it.



You wanna involve? 
******************
Quick ORM is released under BSD lisence.

Acknowledgements
****************
Quick ORM is built upon SQLAlchemy - the famous Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper. All of the glory belongs to the SQLAlchemy development team and the SQLAlchemy community! My contribution to Quich ORM becomes trivial compared with theirs( to SQLAlchemy).
